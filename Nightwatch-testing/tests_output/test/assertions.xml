       An error occurred while creating a new ChromeDriver session: [SessionNotCreatedError] session not created: Chrome failed to start: crashed.
  (session not created: DevToolsActivePort file doesn&#39;t exist)
  (The process started from chrome location C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe is no longer running, so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed.)
  Verify if ChromeDriver is configured correctly; using:
  {
     start_process: true,
     server_path: &#39;&#39;,
     port: undefined,
     host: &#39;localhost&#39;,
     ssl: false,
     default_path_prefix: &#39;&#39;,
     proxy: undefined,
     cli_args: []
  }

 
  Set webdriver.log_path in your Nightwatch config to retrieve more logs from ChromeDriver.
